    qoa.adb:80:56: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for residual
    / (2 ** 4) [reason for check: result of division must be convertible to the target
    type of the conversion] [possible fix: add precondition (residual / (2 ** 4) in
    Integer_16) to subprogram at qoa.ads:91][#0]

    machine integer] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at qoa.ads:91 should
