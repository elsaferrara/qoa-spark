qoa.adb:80:56: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for residual / (2 ** 4) [reason for check: result of division must be convertible to the target type of the conversion] [possible fix: add precondition (residual / (2 ** 4) in Integer_16) to subprogram at qoa.ads:91][#0]
qoa.adb:84:48: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for lms.weights (i) - d [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in a 16-bits machine integer] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at qoa.ads:91 should mention lms][#1]
qoa.adb:86:48: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for lms.weights (i) + d [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 16-bits machine integer] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at qoa.ads:91 should mention lms][#2]
qoa.adb:92:45: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for sample [reason for check: value must be convertible to the target type of the conversion] [possible fix: add precondition (sample in Integer_16) to subprogram at qoa.ads:91][#3]
